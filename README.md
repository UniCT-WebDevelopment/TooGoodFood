# TooGoodFood
Too Good Food is a full-stack project that allows a generic restaurant to offer an online ordering service to its customers. Each customer can access the app via any browser, to see the restaurant menu or register to place an order. Before the order is commissioned, a check is carried out on the products, in order to determine if there are the necessary ingredients for the preparation.

## How It Works
The project was developed entirely in HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end. Backend side instead,
it was decided to use NodeJS to communicate with a SQL database necessary to keep all data relating to products, for example.


## Getting Started & Setup
Before starting, is required to install XAMP/MAMP and create a database called food_db, then follow this steps.

```
git clone https://github.com/Giovannimbesi25/Reddit-Post-Classificator.git
cd TooGoodFood/
node app.js

```
Then you just need to access localhost:5000 by your browser. Port 5000 can be changed by editing the port.txt file.
